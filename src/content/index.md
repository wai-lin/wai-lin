# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wai Lin Aung, a web developer and a tote-bag fanatic.
Currently, I'm trying to snuggle into GoLang and FP zone.
I do WebUIs, JS libraries, etc... I use both vscode and vim btw ðŸ˜‰.

Aside from coding, I enjoy cooking, badminton and table tennis.

I do: `Vue.JS`, `React.JS`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `CSS`, `HTML`
